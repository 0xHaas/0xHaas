### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, Iâ€™m Jonathan Haas - co-founder and CEO of [ThreatKey](https://threatkey.com) based in San Francisco. I go by [0xHaas](https://keybase.io/0xHaas) online. I can usually be found at first@domain.com where I work. Iâ€™m a big fan of open source and Iâ€™m always looking for ways to contribute. Iâ€™m also a big fan of the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org) and [Webmention](https://indieweb.org/Webmention) and Iâ€™m always looking for ways to improve my own site.

I'm currently hiring for a [Senior Backend Engineer](https://jobs.gusto.com/postings/threatkey-inc-backend-engineer-fcbec2f5-4a1c-4a41-af04-9361bc99a4ef) and a [Senior Frontend Engineer](https://jobs.gusto.com/postings/threatkey-inc-senior-frontend-developer-69508d3c-648a-451a-8052-c0362724123a) at ThreatKey. If you're interested in working with me, please apply! We're a small but mighty team and we're looking for people who are excited to work on a product that makes the world safer. We're a fully remote team, and we're looking primarily for people who are willing to work in the US timezone.
